This software has been tested on:
- Intel platforms running several versions of Linux, including Ubuntu, Debian,
  Arch Linux, Fedora (both 32 and 64 bits)
- MAC platform running OS X 10.10


Contents of this distribution:
- Sources
- Licensing information ( COPYING )
- Build system based on GNU Autotools
- Dockerfile

Dependencies:
To be able to succesfully build foliautils from source, you need the following dependencies:

- [ticcutils](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ticcutils)
- [libfolia](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/libfolia)
- [ucto](https://github.com/LanguageMachines/ucto)
- libicu-dev
- libxml2-dev
- libexttextcat-dev OR libtextcat-dev (OS dependant)
- A sane C++ build environment with autoconf, automake, autoconf-archive, make, gcc or clang, libtool, pkg-config

To install ticcutils, libfolia and ucto, first consult whether your
distribution's package manager has an up-to-date package. If not, you can use
the supplied `build-deps.sh` script to automatically download and install the
latest stable versions of these dependencis dependencies. You can pass a target
directory prefix as first argument and you may need to prepend `sudo` to ensure
you can install there.  

To compile and install FoLiA-utils manually from source, provided you have all the
dependencies installed, do:

```
$ bash bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

## Container Usage

A pre-made container image can be obtained from Docker Hub as follows:

```
docker pull proycon/foliautils
```

You can build a docker container as follows, make sure you are in the root of this repository:

```
docker build -t proycon/foliautils .
```

This builds the latest stable release, if you want to use the latest development version from the git repository instead, do:

```
docker build -t proycon/foliautils --build-arg VERSION=development .
```

Run the container interactively as follows:

```
docker run -t -i proycon/foliautils
```

Or invoke the tool you want:

```
docker run proycon/foliautils FoLiA-page
```

Add the -v /path/to/your/data:/data parameter (before -t) if you want to mount your data volume into the container at /data .
